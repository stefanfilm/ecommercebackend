## Description
My motivation to create this project was to make a to create an e-commerce backend application to track inventory. I built this project to create a streamlined way to add, remove, and update items into the inventory. This site solves the problem of not having an application to quickly process inventory changes. I learned how to use SQL routes and to create this application.

## Deployed Site

This is a node application and it is accessible on the command line.

## Installation
